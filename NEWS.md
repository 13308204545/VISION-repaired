# VISION 1.0.0

* Added Layout Options to the output report
* Selected cells can now be saved/loaded
* Addition of "get*"-style accessor methods to the VISION object
* Added an interface to Seurat objects
* Added convenience methods for working with outputs from 10x Genomic's CellRanger
* **Note**: Some changes were made to the Vision object structure and how results are stored.  If updating to 1.0.0, older Vision objects may need to be re-created and re-run before using `viewResults`
