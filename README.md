FastProjectR
===========
Here we present FastProjectR, an extension of FastProject for R, enabling the two-dimensional visualization of single-cell data. The software package utilizes a wide spectrum of projection methods and provides functionality for systematically investigating the biological relevance of these low dimensional represenations by incorporating domain knowledge. While preserving the spirit of the first version, this R extension most importantly now supports the analysis of massive amounts of cell data - theoretically up to a million cells sequenced at any depth - and an improved visualization platform that allows for subset analysis based on the two dimensional representation.
